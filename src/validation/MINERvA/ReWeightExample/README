This is an example application that can run GENIE re-weighting machinery,
and outputs the results in a form of RWBranchDesc and RWRecord oibjects.

The weight calculators used in this example are all standard.
More information on the matter can be found in Chapter 8 (p.129) of 
GENIE Physics and User Manual:
https://genie.hepforge.org/manuals/GENIE_PhysicsAndUserManual_20130615.pdf

In general, this example has been greatly inspired by the standard GENIE 
reweighting application gRwght1Scan (see $GENIE/src/support/rwght).

The RWBranchDesc and RWRecord belong to the ReWeightIO sub-package:
$GENIE/src/validation/MINERvA/ReWeightIO

In order to build this example, you should:
a) make sure that all GENIE environment variables are setup
b) make sure that the libReWeightIO has been built; if not, you should 
build it (instructins are available in the corresponding README)

The Makefile is provided for this application, and you can simply type 
`make' in order to build it.

At present, it'll open input GENIE MC sample in a foom of Root file, and 
will create in it a dedicate TTree with the name "reweighting", and will 
write RWRecord objects into a branch corresponding to a systematic parameter
you choose to tweak; the name of the branch will be the same as the name of
the systematic parameter in question.

NOTE-1: Other modes (e.g. "cherry-pick", etc.) will be enebled shortly

NOTE-2: You can feed the application with one or multiple input MC samples. 

NOTE-2: At present we reweight CCQE events, but the applications can be 
easily expanded to include other options.

Example usage:
rw_app -g <input-mc-spec>.xml -s MaCCQE -t -0.5,0.5

Example input spec xml file is offered:
example_mc.xml
but should be used ONLY AS INSPIRATION, because it points to speficic sample
in a specific user area, on a specific node (click.fnal.gov).

The name of systematic parameter MaCCQE is ** mandatory ** (for the list of 
standard names please see $GENIE/src/ReWeight/GSyst.h).

The -t field allows to specify the tweaks of the systematic parameter in question;
the tweaks are expressed in the units of parameter's sigma.
