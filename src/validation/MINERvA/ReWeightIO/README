This package is an initial, relatively simplistic attempt to expand GENIE EDM by introducing 
I/O infrastructure into the event reweighting  machinery.

In general, event weight can be calculated based on a "tweak" of a given systematic parameter; 
the "tweak" is expressed in the units of parameter's sigma.
Event weight can be re-calculated as many times as the user desires.

Example application that uses this infrastructure is offered in
$GENIE/src/validation/ReWeightExample

It'll create in an MC sample a seaparte tree (TTree) of the name "reweighting", and for each
parameter to tweak will create a dedicated branch populated with RWRecord objects.

RWRecord contains a collection of tweak-weight pair; it's organized in a form STL vector.

If weight calculation doesn't make sense for a particular event, such event can be skipped.
In such case the RWRecord can still be written out but the container will be empty; the access
methods will then return tweak=0. and weight=1.

RWBranchDesc is an object that allows to write branch-specific metada to the "reweighting" tree,
in a form of UserInfo (access: TList* TTree::GetUserInfo())
At present, the RWBranchDesc object consist of 
a) parameter (branch) name
b) parameter MEAN
c) parameter sigma+ and sigma- (errors can be asymetric)

Once you setup GENIE and all its environment variables, you can build this library by typing `make'.
