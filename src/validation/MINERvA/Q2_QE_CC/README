The write-up contains very short information about the application, together with several 
practical tips/instructions.

1. General Info and Setup

In order to build and run the application, you'll need:
-- GENIE package (and all its externals/dependencies)
-- RooMUHisto package (see papt 2)

GENIE is often centrally available of many machines/clusters at Fermilab.

The RooMUHisto package needs to be build, as it's still development/test stage.

For this particular excercise you need to do the following:

a) login to cluck.fnal.gov
b) source /products/setup
c) setup genie v2_8_0d -q "e4:prof"
d) build/setup RooMUHistos - see part 2
e) if you have RooMUHistos already build, you'll only need to run the following:
   cd /to/where/RooMUHistos
   source env_set.sh
   
Now you should be reasonably set to build and run the application.

2. Histogram Plotter-Analyzer (RooMUHistos)

We use the RooMUHisto framework to display and compare the experimental data and/or simulated results.

Minimal instructions are as follow:

a) choose where you want to install the package
b) git clone https://github.com/ManyUniverseAna/RooMUHistos
c) Bear in mind that upon GENIE setup you'll have ROOT setup as well, so you wont need to worry about
   installing ROOT which is required for RooMUHisto
d) cd RooMUHistos
e) source env_set.sh
f) cd PlotUtils
g) make

If you wish, yu can also build and try examples
h) cd ../macros
i) make


3. Generate GENIE sample


  -- Splines

For this particular application you can download the vA splines from hepforge.

Example:
   mkdir splines
   cd splines
   wget  https://www.hepforge.org/archive/genie/data/2.8.0/gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml.gz
   gunzip gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml.gz
      
NOTE: you can also use more recent version of splines, e.g. 2_8_4

  -- Composite target
  
MINERvA target is made of Hydrocarbon (CH), which should be treated as a composite target.

  -- Flux file
  
The MINERvA flux files for nu and nubar have been extracted from the MINERvA publications.
We have stored them with the application as 
./flux-MINERvA/nu-flux-MINERvA.data
./flux-MINERvA/nubar-flux-MINERvA.data

  -- Running gengev with the neutrino projectile on Hydrocarbon tahget

gevgen -r 1 -n 100000 -p 14 -e 1.5,10 -t1000010010[0.077418],1000060120[0.922582] \
--cross-sections ./splines/gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml \
-f ./flux-MINERvA/nu-flux-MINERvA.data

This will generate 100K events for the neutrino ( -p 14 ) projectile incident of the 
Hydrocarbon target (the -t argument field ) using splines for vA and MINERvA flux file.
Based on the contents of the MINERvA flux file, the neutrino energy range is set at 1.5-10GeV 
( -e 1.5,10).
The run number is 1 ( -r 1 ). 
Because the the run number is 1 in this case, the output file will be named gntp.1.ghep.root 
(in general, the naming convenstion is gntp.<run-number>.ghep.root).

4. GENIE Event Reweighting

In this exercise we have used a custom-implemented re-weighting utility, which in its turn
relies on the dedicated I/O infrastructure introduced specifically for tweak-weight objects.
Please visit ReWeightIO and ReWeightExample packages, also in validation/MINERvA area; see
corresponding README files for initial instructions.

As a result of running ReWeightExample/rw_app 
$GENIE/src/validation/MINERvA/ReWeightExample/rw_app -g <input-mc>.xml -s MaCCQE -t <twk1, twk2,...>
the original GENIE sample (see above) can be updated by adding a "reweighting" tree.

NOTE: "MaCCQE" is the name of the GENIE parameter that describes the axial mass for CC QE.
For the list of other names, please see $GENIE/src/ReWeight/GSyst.h 

We will use the resulting updated sample on input to out validation application. 


5. The Experimental Data

The data are stored in a plain ASCII file in the dedicated subdirectory:
./exp-MINERvA/nu-Hydrocarbon.data
./exp-MINERvA/nubar-Hydrocarbon.data


6. Building the Validation Application

Before building the validation application itself, one needs to build the RooMUHistos package,
as it'll need to be linked (see earlier in this write-up)

Once RooMUHisto is configured and built, the validation application can be build with the help of
the provided Makefile; simply type "make".

The resulting executable will be gvld_MINERvA_Q2_QE_CC.

8. Running the Application

At present the application allows to specify the experimental data at run time.

The path  to GENIE sample and the path to GENIE re-weighting files are currently hardcoded.
This will change in the near future.

you can run it as follows:
./gvld_MINERvA_Q2_QE_CC -d MINERvA_expdata_input.xml

8. Output

At present, the application produces 4 (four) GIF-formatted images per projectile-nucleon configuration:
-- MINERvA-<projectile>-<nucleon>-Q2QE-1.gif - an overlay of MINERvA data and the GENIE predicions, including 
                                               an uncertainty band on the MC, that come from varirying M_a 
					       parameter of GENIE (re-weighting); the chi2/ndf on the CV histo
	                                       is calculated using the data error matrix
-- MINERvA-<projectile>-<nucleon>-Q2QE-2.gif - an overlay of MINERvA data and the GENIE predicions, where 
                                               the uncertainty band is represented but several color-coded 
					       histogram that the band is composed of; the chi2/ndf on the 
					       CV histo is calculated using the data error matrix; the chi2/ndf 
					       is also calculated for each variant in the band, also using 
					       the data error matrix 
-- MINERvA-<projectile>-<nucleon>-Q2QE-3.gif - Data/MC ratio plot, including the uncertainty band on the MC: 
                                               the chi2/ndf on the CV histo is calculated using the uncertainties 
					       on the MC (from re-weighting)
-- MINERvA-<projectile>-<nucleon>-Q2QE-4.gif - an overlay of MINERvA and the GENIE predictions, including 
                                               the uncertaintiy band on the MC, all in the form of "shape-only"; 
					       the chi2/ndf is also calculated with the "shape-only" technique,
	                                       using the data shape-only error matrix
