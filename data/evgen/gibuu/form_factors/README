There are 6 files for each resonance:

FF for scattering off protons (one for EM, CC, NC)
FF for scattering off neutrons (one for EM, CC, NC)



Each file has 9 columns:

For isospin 1/2 resonances:

Qs  F_1^V  F_2^V  --  --  F_A  F_P  --  --


For isospin 3/2 resonances:

Qs  C_3^V  C_4^V  C_5^V  C_6^V  C_3^A  C_4^A  C_5^A  C_6^A
