The PDF set included here was producted by Graeme Watt (Durham, UK) to
correct a kink in the PDFs for the default version of GRV98lo that
is available in LHAPDF 5.9.x. The patched version recreates:
  http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk//hepdata/pdflib/grv/grv98/grv98.f 

Our thanks to Graeme and LHAPDF for the patched file. Please note that 
this file will work _only_ with LHAPDF 5.x and is not properly formatted
for LHAPDF 6.

The patched PDF file name is: GRV98lo_patched.LHgrid, and it has size 
111513.

You must copy this PDF to your $LHAPATH in order to take advantage of
the fix.
